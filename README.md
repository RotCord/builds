# RotCord Builds

Automated Vencord builds. For the Vencord source code and reporting issues or submitting patches, please see [RotCord/RotCord](https://github.com/RotCord/RotCord)

This repo serves as both a RotCord Build archive and to host the UserScript (as github releases have cors issue so some UserScript managers fail to update)
